			<p> My name is Quan (pronounced somewhat like "tron" in Megatron). I moved to Chicago in 2010 from China to pursue a PhD degree in biology/biomedical sciences at the Unviversity of Chicago. You can find my graduate work in finding a cure for a devastating muscle wasting disease highlighted <a href = "https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2015/10/23/rna-editing-technique-treats-severe-form-muscular-dystrophy"> here. </a> </p> 

			<p class = "p2"> Years past, degree obtained, I carried on research work but switched disease of interest to cancer. You can find my newest work into cancer "assassin" molecules <a href = https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/october/suicide-molecules-kill-any-cancer-cell/> here. </a> The field of biomedical sciences is booming with big data and the need to understand it. Ever since I taught myself R for experimental analysis, I got interested in delving deeper into the programming world. I like executing logic, identifying rules, fixing problems (even if it's that stupid office printer), and building things.
